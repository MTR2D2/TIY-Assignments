//: ## Question 1
//: ### Prime Numbers
//: Implement the following functions. The divides function returns ```true``` if ```a``` is divisible by ```b``` and ```false``` otherwise. The ```countDivisors``` function should use the ```divides``` function to return the number of ```divisors``` of ```number```. The ```isPrimefunction``` should use the ```countDivisors``` function to determine if ```number``` is prime.

func divides(a: Int, b: Int) -> Bool
{
}

func countDivisors(number: Int) -> Int
{
}

func isPrime(number: Int) -> Bool
{
}

//: ## Question 2
//: ### First Primes
//: Using ```isPrime``` from the previous question, write a function named ```printFirstPrimes``` that takes a parameter named ```count``` of type ```Int``` that prints the first ```count``` prime numbers. For example, if ```count``` were set to 5, it would print "2, 3, 5, 7, 11"



//: ## Question 3
//: ### Reverse
//: Write a function named ```reverse``` that takes an array of integers named ```numbers``` as a parameter. The function should return an array with the numbers from ```numbers``` in reverse order.



//: ## Question 4
//: ### Time Difference
//: Write a function named ```timeDifference```. It takes as input four numbers that represent two times in a day and returns the difference in minutes between them. The first two parameters ```firstHour``` and ```firstMinute``` represent the hour and minute of the first time. The last two ```secondHour``` and ```secondMinute``` represent the hour and minute of the second time. All parameters should have external parameter names with the same name as the local ones.

func timeDifference(firstHour: Int, firstMinute: Int, secondHour: Int, secondMinute: Int) -> Int
{
}
