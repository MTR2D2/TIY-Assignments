//Coding Kata Week 1
//Question 1
//
//Multiples of 3 and 5
//
//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

let naturalNumbers = 1..<1000
var total = 0

for number in naturalNumbers
{
    if number % 3 == 0 || number % 5 == 0
    {
        total += number
    }
}

print(total)



//Question 2
//
//Largest Palindrome Product
//
//A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
/*hint: As a hint for the second question of the coding kata this week, the largest palindromic number produced from multiplying two 3-digit numbers is 906609.*/
